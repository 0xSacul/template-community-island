# Template Community Island (JavaScript)

A simple template for Sunflower Land Community Island.

## Getting Started

Once the template cloned on your computer, you need to intall the dependencies using

`npm install`

Everything's installed? Nice! Now to host your local island you can use

`npm run dev`

This command will start a little web server on your computed on the **port 5500**.

## Adding your own map & tileset

Nice so you have your local island ready and running, now let's add your map and tileset!

Browse through the folder `/public`, there you can already see a basic `map.json` which we'll remove and replace with your own map file exported from Tiled.

In the same folder, you also need to add your own `tileset.png`.

## Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

Your local island is now ready to be used and worked on!
